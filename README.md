# IT CROWD Challenge

## Deployment ‚òÅÔ∏è
Backend: [Heroku](https://itcrowd-ch.herokuapp.com/api/products)  

Frontend: [Vercel](https://it-crowd-challenge-marcopoggi.vercel.app/products)  

Database: ElephantSQL(private)

## Backend ü•∑üèª
**Libraries:**
 - [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors): Simplifies the way of handling everything related to access control, header configuration, etc.
 - [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): To load environment variables from an .env file.
 - [express](https://expressjs.com/): To create the api and start our server, although it could be done with the node http module, it is much simpler to use this framework.
 - [jsonwebtoken(JWT)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken): used for authentication.
 - [pg, pg-hstore, sequelize](https://sequelize.org/): libraries in order to be able to use postgreSQL and sequelize.

**Brief description:**
The **backend**(developed with express) connects to the postgre **database**, then through a `json file`, which contains false data from different products, the database is initialized. Through the defined endpoints you can **create**, **update**, **read** and **delete** the products. In addition, certain actions are restricted (**authentication** will be required).

**Endpoints:**
üü© **`GET`**

 - `/products`: returns as response an array with all the products in the database
 - `/products/:id`: returns an object with the product information as a response
 - `/brands`: returns as response an array with all the brands in the database

üü® **`POST`**
Authetication token is required:

    Headers: {'Authorization':'Bearer ...token'}

 - `/products`: receives by body the data of the product and the brand. Return the product created.
 ```json

	}
}
```

  ```json

	{
	"id":"e229cda0-e039-4f63-9e87-a2ac0eb5b2fa",

	}

## Frontend üåà   
**Libraries:**
 - [react](https://es.reactjs.org/): to create the different interfaces in a simple and composable way.
 - [wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter): to obtain a fairly simple SPA, it is similar to react router, but it occupies less space, and for this challenge it was more than enough.


**Brief description:**
The **client** consumes from the **backend** the products stored in the database. You can see in the `/products` route all the *paginated* products. Each product can be clicked and will take us to a **detailed** route that is responsible for displaying all the data, including the brand of the product. Also in our header there is a button **login** (only for administrator), once the session is started we will have access to the **administration panel**.
