# IT CROWD Challenge

## Deployment ‚òÅÔ∏è
Backend: [Heroku](https://itcrowd-ch.herokuapp.com/api/products)  

Frontend: [Vercel](https://it-crowd-challenge-marcopoggi.vercel.app/products)  

Database: ElephantSQL(private)

## Backend ü•∑üèª
**Libraries:**
 - [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors): Simplifies the way of handling everything related to access control, header configuration, etc.
 - [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): To load environment variables from an .env file.
 - [express](https://expressjs.com/): To create the api and start our server, although it could be done with the node http module, it is much simpler to use this framework.
 - [jsonwebtoken(JWT)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken): used for authentication.
 - [pg, pg-hstore, sequelize](https://sequelize.org/): libraries in order to be able to use postgreSQL and sequelize.
